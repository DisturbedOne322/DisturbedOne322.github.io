                        <strong>I love games!</strong> I`ve been playing computer games since childhood, and see myself playing them later on. I see games as a good way of entertaining yourself, there are so much of them that every living person will find on to their liking.
                        But games can also be a work of art. When the developers put their soul into creation, make great music, gameplay, story, atmosphere, that`s when a game could be considered masterpiece, even if its indie developers. That`s the kind of games I like the most.

                        <strong>Mistakes happen...</strong> I`m just joking around, there is nothing bad about anime. Just like any other series, movies or cartoons can be masterpiece or bad
                        , the same thing is about anime. I like how much intellectual space for creation manga creators have, the title can be about anything you could imagine because you they can draw anything they want.
                        In anime I value the most music, story and emotional ties that are created with me and characters.

                        I fell in love with cars a long time ago. To me, cars are more than just pieces of metal and rubber. I truly believe that cars have souls and create bounds with the owner.
                        Every car is special, but my favorites are the JDM cars from the 90`s - 00`s. That`s the time when car culture truly shined and most interesting cars were made. Certainly, I was also influenced by an "Initial D" anime and Internet, where I also found a new genre of music to my liking, eurobeat.
                        I dream of buying JDM car some day. Can`t even make up my mind of which car exactly, they all are too cool!
